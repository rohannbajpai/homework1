The difference between a merge and a rebase, is that a merge applies the new commits on top of the current state of the main branch keeping the history of both branches in tact while a rebase applies commits throughout the main branch in order, losing the state of the new branch but keeping the commit history of the main branch cleaner.
2. A remote repository is a base of code that is held somewhere other than a programmers personal computer. This is used often to have a central "truth" of a codebase which developers can clone locally to add new features, and push their code back up to the remote repository for other developers to build off of once they are done.
